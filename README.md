# Credit Card Froud Detection  

<> The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset contains anonymized transaction data with features representing transaction details and a target variable indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent. The goal is to analyze the data and build models that can detect fraudulent transactions effectively

<> The dataset was explored to understand distributions and class imbalance. Data preprocessing included scaling numerical features and balancing classes using techniques like undersampling. Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest were trained and evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, since accuracy alone is not reliable due to class imbalanc

<> The analysis showed that fraudulent transactions are very rare compared to normal ones , highlighting the need for careful handling of imbalance . Models like Random Forest achieved strong results with high recall, meaning they successfully identified most fraud cases while keeping false positives reasonable. This demonstrates that data balancing and proper evaluation metrics are critical for fraud detection tasks.
